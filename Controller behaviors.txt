Controller behaviors
On Power Up
32U4 should boot to it's sketch that will monitor the RX for data from the radio
8As should boot like a normal Arduino UNO R3 SMD waiting 8 seconds for programming
and then running their sketch which will act as an I2C slave for commands to run the motors
either at a constant rate or to a specific angle. These commands can be letter codes and numbers
that come over the I2C or over the UART.
